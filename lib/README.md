# Love Libs

A collection of small Love2d libraries for speeding up game development. All libraries are created with minimalism and flexibility in mind, thus they should be easy to expand upon and to use.

## Where are the libraries?

In each folder you will find a `lib/` directory, that contains the respective library.

The folder also contains a `README.md` for each library, as well as a `main.lua` file that can be used to see the library in action.

## Overview

`Scene Manager (SM)`

A simple library for scene management, scenes are just considered as .lua files, that can be defined quickly and called easily.

`Stacking Scene Manager (SSM)`

An improved version of SM with the ability to layer scenes, freeze scenes, and much more.

`Transition Manager (TM)`

A library for transition effect management, transitions are just considered as .lua files, that can be defined quickly and called easily. Pairs well with my scene managers.

`Camera Manager (CM)`

A highly dynamic and robust camera library in around 200 lines of code.

`Collision Library (CL)`

A library containing all the basic collision functions. Intended to be used for building more complex collision systems on top of.

`Input Manager (IM)`

A library that expands the base functionality of love2ds mouse/keyboard input.
